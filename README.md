# fp-ts-dom [**WIP**]

The idea behind this package is to provide a _almost_ drop-in wrapper for the
`window` object using [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) types where
appropriate. As well as wrappers for most native objects.

Feel free to post issues with questions, comments and suggestions. ðŸ˜€
