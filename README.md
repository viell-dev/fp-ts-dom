# fp-ts-dom [**WIP**]

The idea behind this package is to provide a _almost_ drop-in wrapper for the
`window` object using [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) types where
appropriate.

Basically, props/methods return options instead of nullable and eithers instead of throwing.

As well as wrappers for most native objects from the HTML and related specs.
